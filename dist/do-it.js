// Commands:
//   hubot how do <group/occupation> do it? -- tells you how they do it (e.g. hubot how do hackers do it?)
//   hubot <people> do it <method> -- tells hubot how <people> do it (e.g. hubot GitHubbers do it in Campfire.)
//   hubot do it -- tells you a random way in which random people do it

// Notes:
//   Node.js programmers do it asynchronously.
